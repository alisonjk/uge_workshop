Below: a few notes taken this morning

Why Learn Unix?

“Apps need a home” be it a laptop, mobile phone, web browser, or server.

unix developed by ppl at AT&T in the 60s.

Unix-like variants:
Linux  is the OS for Android
Darwin is the Mac equivalent

“We take subdirectories for granted.”

Unix is basically everpresent.


Unix Kernel: just a program. it manages the hardware. it is the strawberry filling in between 1) the other programs and 2) cpu, memory, devices

The kernel is safe from hackers. It is the thing that asks for your UN and PW.

Unix Shell: is another program. provides a user interface to the kernel.
Commands are given via the keyboard, and then interpreted by the computer. Modern systems introduced a graphic user interface to make this process more accessible. the GUI is a shell. audible user commands are also a SHELL.  but when we talk about shell, we are talking about the command line thing.

The shell protects the kernel from corrupted downloads or other things that could hack the server.

uname=“unix name”
